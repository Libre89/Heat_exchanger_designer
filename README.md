# About Heat Exchanger Designer

This python program is designed for the construction of polymer heat exchangers on the X-Winder device.  Based on the parameters entered by the user, the program generates a G-code which controls the X-Winder winding device and produces the heat exchanger.

# X-Winder

The core of the exchanger is manufactured on an X-Winder 4X-C winding machine with four axes of motion. The winder is originally controlled by the X-Winder Desinger software supplied with the winder. However, the winder was not designed for the production of heat exchangers and therefore the use of the software for the purpose of heat exchanger production is very difficult.

# Polymer Hollow Fiber Heat Exchanger

Heat exchangers constructed from polymer hollow fibers create the potential for a possible replacement of conventional metal heat exchangers. Polymer hollow fibers are chemically resistant, corrosion-resistant, lightweight, easy to shape, and less energy-consuming than conventional metal heat exchangers (lower CO2 production during production).

The principle of this exchanger is shown below.
